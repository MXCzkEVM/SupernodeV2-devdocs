This guide will help you deploy a smart contract to Moonchain (Geneva testnet) using Foundry.

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) is installed.
- You have the private key handy to an account that has Test MXC Token on Moonchain Geneva (to pay the transaction fee for deploying the contract).
    - [Retrieve private key with MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key#:~:text=On%20the%20account%20page%2C%20click,click%20%E2%80%9CConfirm%E2%80%9D%20to%20proceed.).

## Steps

### Create a project with Foundry
To scafold a new foundry run:
```sh
forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
```

### Deploy the contract

Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some Test MXC Token on Moonchain Geneva testnet.

Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`.

```sh
forge create --rpc-url https://geneva-rpc.moonchain.com --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
```

:::info
Deploy using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) if you get an error ->  Error: (code: -32000, message: contract creation code storage out of gas, data: None)!
:::

### View your contract
Paste the address from the output into the [Moonchain Geneva block explorer](https://geneva-explorer.moonchain.com) and verify that the contract was deployed.
