## Deploying a Subgraph 
### Part I

This tutorial will guide you through deploying an already initialized subgraph tailored for the MXCMarketplace smart contract on the Geneva Testnet using The Graph.

## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) allows developers to query blockchain data easily using GraphQL. It provides powerful tools to index blockchain data and serve it through a GraphQL endpoint, enabling efficient data access for decentralized applications.

To get started with deploying our preinitited subgraph on the Geneva Testnet, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone the repository and switch to the `geneva` branch:

    ````
    git clone --branch geneva https://github.com/MXCzkEVM/mxc-nft-graph.git
    cd mxc-nft-graph
    ````
2. **Install Required Packages:**
    Install the necessary packages:
    ````
    yarn add global package.json
    ````
### Steps for deployment

Note: In this tutorial section, we omit the 'init' command typically used to initialize a new subgraph. This is because Geneva Testnet and similar non-standard networks are not supported by the standard init command of The Graph. Instead, we focus on generating the subgraph code directly from the existing schema.

Please refer to Part 2 of this tutorial series for advanced configurations and specific setup instructions tailored to non-standard networks like Geneva Testnet.

1. **Code Generation:**
    Generate the subgraph code:

    ````
    graph codegen
    ````
2. **Build the Subgraph:**
    Build & compile the subgraph:
    ````
    graph build
    ````
3. **Create the Subgraph**
    Generate the subgraph code, replacing <SUBGRAPH-NAME> with the actual name of your subgraph:

    ````
    graph create --node http://geneva-graph-node.moonchain.com:8020/ <SUBGRAPH-NAME>
    ````
4. **Deploy the Subgraph:**
    Deploy the subgraph using graph deploy to the Geneva Testnet node specified. Again, replace <SUBGRAPH-NAME> with the actual name of your subgraph:

    ````
    graph deploy --node http://geneva-graph-node.moonchain.com:8020/ <SUBGRAPH-NAME>
    ````
    Upon successful deployment, you will receive the URL where you can interact with your MXCMarketplace subgraph.

### Conclusion

Use GraphQL queries such as the following example to explore and utilize the capabilities of your deployed subgraph:

    query {
        marketplaceOrderInfos {
        id
        assetId
        seller
        nftAddress
        blockNumber
        blockTimestamp
        transactionHash
        event
        priceInWei
        expiresAt
        totalPrice
        buyer
        }
    }

This query retrieves information about orders made on the marketplace, demonstrating how you can leverage your subgraph to access and analyze marketplace order data effectively on the Geneva Testnet.
