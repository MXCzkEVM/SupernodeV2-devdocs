This guide will help you build the MangaDrop dapp on MXC (Geneva testnet)! The airdrop dapp highlights an important feature of MXC: deploying ERC20 tokens and conducting airdrops seamlessly. You can deploy tokens, manage them, and execute airdrops all through our user-friendly interface. Read more about the functionalities and architecture in our detailed documentation [here](https://github.com/MXCzkEVM/token-airdrop-x2e/tree/geneva).

## Prerequisites

- A curiosity to learn and build.

## Steps
1. Try Token [airdrop templates](https://github.com/MXCzkEVM/token-airdrop-x2e/blob/geneva/) to create airdrop in one-click

## Status page integration

Remember to integrate the status widget in case the zkEVM operational status is changed
```
<script src="https://mxc.instatus.com/13076080/widget/script.js">
</script>
```

This will show a pop-up widget if the zkEVM has a new incident.
