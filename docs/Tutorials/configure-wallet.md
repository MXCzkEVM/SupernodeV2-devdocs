# Configure Wallets

This guide helps you connect your wallet to the Moonchain mainnet as well as the Moonchain Geneva (testnet). For configuring the testnet, there are two networks to set up: 
**Moonchain (Geneva Testnet)** and **Arbitrum One (Sepolia).**

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

### 1. Add the Moonchain Geneva testnet
Visit [https://doc.mxc.com/docs/Resources/RPC](https://doc.mxc.com/docs/Resources/RPC), here you see the RPC Configuration. Open your Metamask wallet, click on the network selection at the top right, and then first click on 'Add Network' and then 'Add a network manually'. Now, enter the RPC configuration details for Moonchain Geneva testnet.

### 2. Add the Arbitrum One (Sepolia) testnet
Visit [(https://chainlist.org/chain/42161)/](https://chainlist.org/chain/42161), Connect with your wallet, then click on 'Add to Metamask' for one of the RPC Server Addresses

## Connection to Moonchain Mainnet
Visit [https://doc.mxc.com/docs/Resources/RPC](https://doc.mxc.com/docs/Resources/RPC), here you see the RPC Configuration. Open your Metamask wallet, click on the network selection at the top right, and then first click on 'Add Network' and then 'Add a network manually'. Now, enter the RPC configuration details for Moonchain Mainnet.

## Troubleshooting
### Metamask doesn't accept the provided RPC Server Address
Try a different RPC Address from ChainList, as not all provided addresses may work correctly.
If the problem persists, you can manually enter the RPC address as mentioned in Step 2.
