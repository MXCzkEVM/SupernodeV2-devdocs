# Moonchain zkEVM Makes Web3 More Accessible

Moonchain is a blockchain-based network that aims to connect millions of IoT devices around the world. To achieve this goal, the network needs to be scalable, secure, and efficient. In an effort to make the network more accessible for projects and people, Moonchain has recently integrated zkEVM, a technology that combines the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs with the power of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This article will explore how zkEVM can make Web3 more accessible for projects, and how its integration has improved the capabilities of the Moonchain network.

## Scalability

One of the main benefits of zkEVM is its scalability. With zkEVM, projects can enjoy the scalability benefits of layer 2 solutions while still retaining the security of Ethereum. This makes it easier for projects to scale up and handle more transactions without sacrificing security. The Moonchain network can also scale up to handle more transactions and data, without incurring high costs or sacrificing security. This is crucial for the network's success in connecting millions of IoT devices around the world.

## Lower Costs

Another benefit of zkEVM is its ability to significantly reduce gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet. This makes it more cost-effective for people to use Web3 applications and dApps. By leveraging zkEVM, projects can save on costs and focus on their core offerings. The integration of zkEVM also allows MXC tokens to be used as gas fees for transactions on the network, increasing their utility and demand.

## Privacy

Zero-knowledge proofs allow for the validation path of transactions to be kept private while still being validated on the public blockchain. This means that users can enjoy a safer experience while transacting on the blockchain. This is especially important for IoT devices that may transmit sensitive data. The integration of zkEVM enhances the privacy of the Moonchain network, ensuring that data transmitted between IoT devices and the blockchain is secure and tamper-proof.

## Increased Token Utility

The integration of zkEVM has also increased the utility of MXC tokens. With the ability to use MXC tokens as gas fees for transactions on the network, the tokens have become more useful and valuable. This has driven up demand for the tokens, making them more valuable for token holders. Additionally, the integration of zkEVM has made the Moonchain network more secure and efficient, further increasing the utility of MXC tokens.

## Enhanced Security

The combination of zero-knowledge proofs and Ethereum Virtual Machine provides an added layer of security to the Moonchain network. With zkEVM, transactions on the Moonchain network can be processed faster, thanks to the technology's ability to handle a higher volume of transactions in a shorter amount of time. The enhanced security of the Moonchain network is crucial for its success in connecting millions of IoT devices around the world.

## Conclusion

The integration of zkEVM has the potential to make Web3 more accessible for projects and people by reducing costs, improving scalability, and enhancing privacy. For the Moonchain network, the integration of zkEVM has significantly enhanced its capabilities, making it more secure, scalable, and efficient, while also increasing the utility and demand for MXC tokens. With these benefits, Moonchain is well-positioned to achieve its goal of connecting millions of IoT devices around the world.
