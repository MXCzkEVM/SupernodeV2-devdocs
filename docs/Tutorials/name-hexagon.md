### 4. Set the name of our Hexagon
- After the confirmed mint of your Hexagon, you are able to name it with an MNS name.
- To do this, click on the "Set to MEP1002 Hexagon" button.
- In the pop-up again enter the hexadecimal number of your selected map area. 
- If you need this number again, you can use the address of your minted hexagon to search for it in the [Geneva ZK Explorer](https://geneva-explorer.moonchain.com/)
