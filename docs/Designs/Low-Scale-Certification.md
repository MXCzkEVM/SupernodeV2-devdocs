LSC is employed to address the limitations of conventional proof of location methods by providing a more secure and reliable means of confirming an object's location and physical existence.

The benefits of LSC include enhanced security, reduced risk of spoofing or tampering, and increased trust in the authenticity of the verified objects.

By leveraging LSC, networks can establish a more robust foundation for location-based services and applications, ensuring that the data being processed is genuine and accurate.

### 1.4 Consensus Group

A Consensus Group is a set of network participants responsible for reaching an agreement on the state or decisions of a distributed system, such as a blockchain.

These participants work together to validate transactions, maintain the integrity of the network, and ensure that the system operates securely and efficiently. This is achieved through the use of consensus algorithms that promote security, network integrity, and fault tolerance.

The specific rules and protocols governing the formation and operation of a Consensus Group can vary depending on the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology being used.

Consensus Groups play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and stability of a distributed system. They are often decentralized and open, which fosters transparent, fair, and democratic decision-making processes. This structure also contributes to the network's resilience by preventing single points of failure and reducing the risk of centralized control or manipulation.

In summary, Consensus Groups are essential components of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, as they help to uphold the core principles of security, decentralization, and trust.

### 1.5 Quorum

A quorum is the minimum number of nodes or participants within a Consensus Group that must agree on a decision or transaction for it to be considered valid.

The quorum ensures that a sufficient level of agreement and participation is achieved, promoting network stability, security, and consistency. The specific quorum requirements may vary depending on the consensus algorithm or network protocol in use.

By requiring a quorum, distributed networks can prevent malicious actors from taking control of the system or manipulating the ledger, as they would need to compromise a significant portion of the Consensus Group to succeed.

Quorum mechanisms contribute to the overall trust and reliability of a distributed system by ensuring that decisions and transactions are made with broad consensus among the participating nodes.

A quorum in a consensus group refers to the minimum number of participants or nodes required to reach an agreement on the state of the blockchain. Establishing a quorum ensures that decisions are made collectively and that a single entity or a small group of nodes cannot manipulate or control the network. Quorums play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity, security, and decentralization of the MXC blockchain.

They are also optimized for energy efficiency and extended connectivity, making them an ideal choice for IoT applications and remote monitoring situations.

Similar to the 2.4 GHz LPWAN miners, Sub GHz LPWAN miners also participate in validating transactions, consensus groups, and maintaining the connection between the physical world and the metaverse.

### 1.8 MXC Hexagons

MXC Hexagons are a conceptual model used within the MXC ecosystem to bridge the physical world and the metaverse by representing the geographical distribution and coverage of LPWAN Miners, such as the 2.4 GHz and Sub GHz devices discussed earlier. This hexagonal grid layout serves as an efficient way to organize and visualize the network coverage provided by these miners, ensuring optimal connectivity and data transmission for IoT devices and applications on Earth while simultaneously mirroring the Earth's grid in the metaverse.

By connecting the Earth and the metaverse through MXC Hexagons, the MXC ecosystem can seamlessly integrate the benefits of both worlds, enabling a more comprehensive and immersive experience for users and network participants. This interconnected model allows for the development and deployment of innovative IoT applications and services that leverage the strengths of both the physical and virtual domains, unlocking new possibilities for communication, data exchange, and resource management.

MXC Hexagons can be used to address various network planning and deployment challenges, such as:

#### 1.8.1 Coverage Optimization:

By arranging LPWAN Miners in a hexagonal pattern, network planners can ensure optimal coverage and signal strength for IoT devices within the network. The hexagonal grid provides a more uniform and consistent coverage area compared to other shapes, like squares or circles, minimizing coverage gaps and signal degradation. Each hexagon is around 2 kilometer in diameter

#### 1.8.2 Network Scalability:

The hexagonal model allows for easy expansion and scalability of the network as new LPWAN Miners are deployed. As the network grows, additional hexagons can be added to the grid, seamlessly integrating with the existing coverage areas and maintaining optimal connectivity.

#### 1.8.3 Resource Allocation:

MXC Hexagons can be used to allocate resources and responsibilities among LPWAN Miners within the network. By dividing the coverage area into hexagonal zones, network operators can assign specific tasks or roles to the miners within each hexagon, such as data processing, transaction validation, or network synchronization, optimizing the overall performance and efficiency of the system.

#### 1.8.4 Network Visualization:

The hexagonal grid provides an intuitive and easy-to-understand representation of the network's coverage and connectivity. Network operators, IoT device manufacturers, and end-users can quickly grasp the network layout, signal strength, and Miner distribution by examining the MXC Hexagons, aiding in network planning, troubleshooting, and device deployment decisions.

#### 1.8.5 Hexagons and Consensus Groups:

MXC Hexagons also play a vital role in the formation and operation of Consensus Groups within the MXC ecosystem. By organizing the LPWAN Miners into hexagonal zones, the network can more effectively distribute the responsibility for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain ledger among the miners.

Each hexagon can be associated with a specific Consensus Group, consisting of miners located within that hexagonal zone. This localized approach allows for faster and more efficient consensus decision-making, as miners within a given hexagon are likely to have stronger connectivity and lower latency compared to miners spread across the entire network.

Furthermore, the hexagonal organization promotes network resilience and security. In the event of a miner failure or malicious activity, the impact on the network is localized to the affected hexagon, preventing the issue from spreading throughout the entire system. This structure also makes it more challenging for an attacker to compromise the network, as they would need to target multiple hexagons and Consensus Groups simultaneously to have a significant impact.

By integrating MXC Hexagons with the Consensus Group structure, the MXC ecosystem can ensure robust network performance, security, and reliability while maintaining the decentralization and democratic decision-making principles that underpin the blockchain technology.

This helps maintain the seamless connection between the physical world and the metaverse and ensures the integrity and reliability of the MXC network.

## Chapter 3 LSC of physical existence for miners and sensors

### 3.1 Decentralized LSC Solution

#### 3.1.1 LSC Device Provisioning

##### Definition

- **Low-Scale Certification (LSC):**
  is a technology used to prove the existence of a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) device in the real world. It is crucial in applications where LPWAN end-devices perform tasks that require interactions with the blockchain. Establishing a strategy for detecting and minimizing the risk of malicious actions by actors pretending to be real, physical devices is essential. In this context, we introduce the concept of LSC - the multilevel network verification of existence.

- **Device provisioning:**
  is the process of establishing a shared secret key between the device and the cloud server to exchange information securely and encrypted. The protocol is based on the Key exchange protocol that uses asymmetric cryptography and is based on the PID (unique device identifier). The device manufacturer purchases the PID from the SuperNode for a fee.

##### Method

Our method for LSC device provisioning involves three steps:

- **Generate the PID:**
  The PID is created by the Device owner on the Super Node using the MEP. The PID costs a fee. The SuperNode then creates an NFT on the blockchain with the PID attached to a secret, only visible to the owner of the NFT. The NFT is then sent to the Creator's wallet.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/4.png)

- **Program the PID into the device:**
  The owner needs to flash the PID into the sensor device it wants to produce. They also need to print a label with the PID so the device can be added to the Data Dash app by scanning it.

- **Device provisioning:**
  PID is just an authenticator of the device; to join, the device needs to perform self-provisioning after it is manufactured.

Two types of keys should be created and exchanged during this process

- _AS128 keys for LPWAN, and_
- _ECC keys for authentication and signing._

The AS128 key will be stored on the Device Provisioning server.
The Public ECC key will be stored on the blockchain, and
the Private ECC key will be only known to the device itself.

The provisioning message sent by the Sensor Device is forwarded to the SuperNode by the Miner, who signs the message with its private key.

![](/img/LSC_img/5.png)

The Miner has its Public Key stored on the blockchain because it was provisioned earlier, so we know it is real.
The SuperNode generates all the keys and sends the AS128 and ECC keys to the Device.
At the same time, it signs the received signed message from the Miner with its own private key and creates a new NFT with this message chain and Device Public key and attaches it to the original NFT with PID on the blockchain.
The NFT can contain more information like the EUI of the device, the certificate of the manufacturer, and so on.

#### 3.1.2 Prerequisites for the Solutions:

To participate in the decentralized LSC solution, there are two prerequisites that an owner can choose from:

##### Staking Stable Coins

Users must stake a certain amount of stable coins as collateral to ensure their commitment to the network and its security.

##### Link To A Social Profile

Users must link their accounts to a social media profile to increase transparency and trustworthiness within the network. This connection helps deter malicious actors from attempting to manipulate or deceive the network.

### 3.2 Benefits Of Decentralized LSC Solution

The decentralized Low-Scale Certification (LSC) solution aims to address the challenges of ensuring the authenticity of devices and assets within the metaverse and the physical world. By leveraging blockchain technology, the solution provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant way to verify the existence of devices and assets. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the network, as well as fostering trust among users and participants.

The decentralized nature of the LSC solution offers several key advantages:

- **Security:**
  By distributing the certification process across multiple nodes in the network, the decentralized LSC solution mitigates the risk of a single point of failure. This makes it more difficult for malicious actors to compromise the system, ensuring the security of devices and assets.

- **Transparency:**
  The LSC solution utilizes blockchain technology, which inherently provides a transparent and auditable record of device certification. This allows users and participants to verify the authenticity of devices and assets easily, promoting trust within the network.

- **Scalability:**
  As the number of devices and assets within the metaverse and the physical world continues to grow, a centralized certification system may struggle to keep up with the demand. The decentralized LSC solution is inherently more scalable, as it can distribute the certification workload across multiple nodes in the network.

- **Flexibility:**
  The decentralized LSC solution allows for more flexible device provisioning and certification processes. By enabling devices to self-provision and participate in the network, the solution can accommodate a wider range of devices and manufacturers.

By implementing the decentralized LSC solution, the system can establish a seamless and secure connection between the metaverse and the physical world, ensuring the authenticity and security of devices and assets within the network. This, in turn, promotes a more reliable and trustworthy environment for users and network participants, laying the foundation for innovative applications and services that leverage the interconnectedness of the two worlds.

## Chapter 4: LSC of Location and Consensus Group

### 4.1 Consensus Group in MXC Blockchain

In the MXC Blockchain, a consensus group is formed when miners collaborate to confirm transactions and record them on the blockchain. This section will explore how this process unfolds, from the initial registration of a miner to the formation and expansion of a consensus group.

#### 4.1.1 Flow of Consensus Group in MXC Blockchain

The process begins when a miner registers within a specific geographical area, known as a hexagon, through the blockchain. The miner's existence is verified using its Provisioning Identifier (PID), and its location is confirmed by linking it to a specific hexagon. This location is then cross-verified by other miners through a process called peer listening.

Once the miner's registration and location have been confirmed, it then links up with at least two other miners to form a consensus group. The configuration of this group depends on the type of miner. If it's a sub-GHz miner, each miner will be located in a separate hexagon. If it's a 2.4 GHz miner, then all three miners will reside in the same hexagon.

![](/img/LSC_img/6.jpeg)

The consensus group then grows and expands, with each group verifying the locations of other consensus groups. The more substantial groups absorb the smaller ones, with the ultimate goal being the formation of a single, dominant consensus group. This growth and merging process is crucial for maintaining the network's stability and security, making it resistant to attacks and failures.

#### 4.1.2 What Influences the Consensus Algorithm

A miner's score is a critical factor in determining its eligibility to join a consensus group. This score is a combination of two metrics:

- Miner Peer Listening and
- Miner fuel.
  The total score of the miners within a group, rather than the average score, determines the strength of the consensus group.

#### 4.1.3 Prerequisites for Joining a Consensus Group

Before a device can join a consensus group,

- it must have been provisioned and
- must have a miner score of at least 510 points.
  - The score is divided between Miner Peer Listening and Miner Fuel.

Miner Peer Listening:
Each hexagon can hold up to

- 10 sub-GHz or
- 50 2.4-GHz miners

for the miner score system. When a hexagon is fully populated, it suggests that each miner is trustworthy.
This metric carries a weight of 49% in the miner's total score.

Miner Fuel:
This metric reflects the number of tokens held within the miner's. A full 100% capacity equates to a 51% score, which makes the miner eligible to join a consensus group.
The tokens in the tank are not only a sign of the miner's authenticity but also an indication of the owner's commitment to the network. This metric carries a weight of 51% in the miner's total score.

### 4.2 Consensus Group Ground Rules:

#### 4.2.1 Definitions

A Consensus Group serves as the collective consciousness of the MXC blockchain, following established protocols and formed under certain conditions. It represents a group of Miners, bound by the law of Quorum, which governs decision-making and merging dynamics within the group.

#### 4.2.2 Commitment to Implementation:

The Consensus Group plays a pivotal role in the MXC blockchain, with responsibilities that include overseeing LPWAN devices and enforcing network rules and procedures.

A core component of these rules is the establishment of certain prerequisites that every miner must meet to qualify for membership in a consensus group.

These prerequisites serve as safeguards, protecting the network and its miners from potential threats posed by non-compliant entities. Furthermore, these requirements ensure the validity of device locations, thus preserving the overall integrity of the network.

Any breach of these rules triggers specific protective measures taken by the Consensus Group to mitigate possible risks to the network.

The ensuing sections provide a comprehensive discussion of these requirements and measures.

- Validation of Miner location.
- Miner bound to Location.
- Exit fee to unbind from location

#### 4.2.3 Validation

Before the Consensus Group formation, LPWAN devices validate their location via the DataDash app. Simultaneously, miner metric scores are verified to ensure data accuracy and miner authenticity.

It is essential that each Miner be bound to a specific coordinate within a hexagon with a minimal margin of error.

#### 4.2.4 Binding Scenario

By default, the Miner Owner binds the Miner's location to a coordinate within a hexagon free of charge, later enabling it to join a Consensus Group and reap its benefits. The miner can only mine if it is bound to a hexagon.
This binding is essential for mining and remains effective for a block time duration after joining a hexagon.
If the Miner fails to join a Consensus Group within this timeframe, an exit fee must be paid for re-binding.
The Exit fee will be explained in the next section.

#### 4.2.5 Exit Fee

- **Definition of Exit Fee:**

  - The exit fee is a payment required when a miner, previously bound to a specific location in a Consensus Group, needs to be unbound.
  - This fee becomes necessary when a miner's location changes, as it would then no longer be part of its original Consensus Group. Hence, the fee covers the cost of unbinding the miner from its current location, allowing for its relocation and subsequent entry into a new consensus group.

- **Functions of the Exit Fee:**

  - A miner, by default, is bound to a particular location before its entry into a consensus group. If the miner's location changes while bound, the miner will be disallowed from mining or utilizing the network.
  - If a miner wishes to change its location or Consensus Group, the miner's owner must pay a fixed fee to unbind it from its current location. This requirement stands even if the miner is expelled from the Consensus Group; the fee is still necessary to unbind it from the location.

- **Benefits of the Exit Fee:**
  - It discourages frequent changes to a miner's location, as users will likely be hesitant to repeatedly pay the fee.
  - In case of a miner being under attack, the miner will cease operations, thereby limiting potential harm.
  - The exit fee mechanism ensures that a miner is strictly bound to a specific location, i.e., a particular hexagon. The payment of the exit fee provides the necessary step to unbind a miner from its location, thereby maintaining network integrity.

**Scenarios:**

1. **Relocation by Miner Owner:**
   In instances where the Miner Owner is relocating to a new place, the Miner Owner is required to pay the exit fee to unbind the miner from its original location. This allows the miner to be re-registered at the new location.

2. **Miner Malfeasance:**
   If a miner is detected to be launching attacks on the network, it will be expelled from its Consensus Group. However, should the miner wish to join a new Consensus Group, the Miner Owner will be required to pay the exit fee to unbind the miner from its current location, thus allowing for its re-entry into a different Consensus Group.
   ![](/img/LSC_img/8.jpeg)

3. **Temporary Relocation:**
   In a situation where the Miner Owner temporarily relocates along with the miner to a different location, the Miner Owner has two options. The Miner Owner can choose to pay the exit fee to register the miner at the temporary location or refrain from paying the fee until they return to the original location where the miner is bound.
   ![](/img/LSC_img/10.jpeg)

4. **Miner Attack:**
   If a miner is being subjected to attacks at the hardware level or the peer listening level, it may appear as if the miner is transmitting an incorrect location, seeming to be located in a different city/town/district/hexagon. Since the Miner Owner has the ability to decide whether or not to pay the exit fee to relocate the bound location of the miner, the miner can be safeguarded from this type of manipulation. During the attack, the miner will not participate in the Consensus Group until it returns to its bound location. This protects the network from potential harm, whether the miner is under attack or if the Miner Owner is launching an attack on the network.

#### 4.2.6 Formation

The formation of a Consensus Group is a process that starts with smaller, individual units coming together to form a larger, more cohesive group.

- **Initial Grouping:** The formation of a Consensus Group begins with the establishment of smaller clusters. These clusters will merge with each other to create a larger, unified Consensus Group.
- **Group Composition:** A Consensus Group comprises at least three miners. For Sub GHz miners, each miner must be in a different hexagon. Conversely, for 2.4 GHz miners, all three should be located within the same hexagon.
- **Score Threshold:** Each miner participating in the Consensus Group must have a miner score of 510 or above.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/11.jpeg)

- **Location Validation:** The miners within a Consensus Group verify each other's locations using Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. These measurements allow each miner to determine the distance to other miners, which is equivalent to the radius of a circle centered on the miner. The miner is expected to be located along the circumference of this circle. The Miner Owner's uploaded coordinates, which were provided when the miner was bound to its location, should intersect with this calculated circumference, thus confirming the validity of the miner's location.

#### 4.2.7 Flexibility

Resilience and adaptability are fundamental to the Consensus Group's operation. The architecture of the Consensus Group is designed to be highly flexible, capable of deconstructing and reforming with different miners as circumstances dictate. This ability to adapt is crucial in responding to shifts in the network or changes in miner behavior.

If an issue arises with a miner, the Consensus Group's flexibility allows for swift and smooth resolution. The problematic miner can be replaced seamlessly without destabilizing the group's function or integrity. Alternatively, if necessary, the entire Consensus Group can disband and be replaced by a new one. This interchangeability helps maintain the group's optimal performance and assures continuous coverage of its designated area.

This flexibility, in essence, enables the Consensus Group to evolve dynamically with the network, maintaining optimal efficiency and responsiveness in the face of changing circumstances. Whether it's miner turnover or unexpected disruptions, the Consensus Group's adaptability ensures it can accommodate these shifts and continue to function effectively.

#### 4.2.8 Data Aggregation

Data aggregation is an integral process in the Consensus Group's operations. It involves the collection and synthesis of data from all Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) devices under the group's governance. Through comprehensive data aggregation, the Consensus Group can ensure that its decision-making processes are informed by the most complete and accurate data set possible.

Key data points gathered in this process include:

- **Miner Scores:** This is a performance measure for each miner based on predefined criteria. These scores play a crucial role in the evaluation of miners, determining their ability to meet network requirements and their potential eligibility for participation in the Consensus Group.
- **Total Consensus Group Score:** A cumulative score that encapsulates the collective performance of all miners within the Consensus Group. This gives a clear picture of the overall operational health of the group.
- **Miner Locations and Verification Status:** These are physical coordinates of miners within the network. Each location must be validated by fellow miners to ensure authenticity and accuracy. Information regarding which miners have successfully verified their locations is also collected.
- **Miner Requirement Compliance:** Data regarding whether a miner continues to meet the minimum requirements or has experienced any failures is essential for maintaining network integrity.
- **Bound Locations:** Every miner is bound to a specific location within the Consensus Group. Data on these bound locations is vital for overseeing network operation and maintaining its structure.
- **Consensus Group Affiliations:** Knowing which Consensus Group each miner belongs to is key to understanding the overall layout and organization of the network.

By diligently aggregating these extensive sets of data, the Consensus Group can maintain a holistic and detailed understanding of the network's state. This promotes effective oversight, facilitates the early detection of potential issues, and ensures the network continues to function efficiently and securely.

### 4.3 Consensus Group and Cluster Decision Making

#### 4.3.1 Quorum

A quorum within a Consensus Group is established by accounting for both the quantity and the cumulative score of the LPWAN devices it encompasses. This approach ensures that decision-making is proportionally weighted according to the size and the collective scores of the miners within each group. The principle in play here is that larger, higher-scoring Consensus Groups hold a more substantial influence, inherently absorbing smaller, lower-scoring groups.

Moreover, the quorum requirement insists on the participation of all miners within a Consensus Group. This holistic participation is vital for decisions pertaining to the blockchain model, ensuring fair representation and collective agreement.

Yet, we acknowledge the potential challenge presented by expansive Consensus Groups, where miners situated at extreme edges of the group may encounter communication difficulties. In such instances, we recommend the formation of a sub-Consensus Group, composed solely of miners who can effectively communicate with the small group.

The primary cluster then validates this newly formed sub-Consensus Group before proceeding with the absorption of another Consensus Group. This process, known as 'consuming', demands a democratic consensus: at least 51% of the miners involved in a verification process with another group must agree to a merger.

This safeguard is in place to prevent any unilateral decisions, fostering a transparent, equitable process when consolidating groups.

#### 4.3.2 Decision-Making Process

The decision-making process in a Consensus Group hinges upon the accurate determination of device locations. This process engages two miner Consensus Groups, each adhering to the stipulated minimums:

- three miners located in distinct hexagons for sub-GHz miners, and
- three miners situated within the same hexagon for 2.4 GHz miners.

These groups exchange essential data and follow established rules for mutual verification. They also engage an auxiliary Consensus Group when confronted with discrepancies or potential threats that warrant further examination.

Each Consensus Group undertakes a thorough verification of miner locations in the counterparty group, producing a boolean table that outlines the correctness of each location, underpinned by a specified degree of certainty.

A mutual agreement, represented by 51% or more of each cluster, that all locations have been appropriately verified, triggers the consolidation process. The group with the higher cumulative score consumes the lower scoring group, leading to a merger that unifies both clusters into a single, larger entity. This procedure aligns with our fundamental principle of bigger, higher-scoring groups absorbing smaller, lower-scoring ones, reinforcing network stability and unity.

| location  | miners             | miner score              | delta.mxc   | echo.mxc    | foxtrot.mxc |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1         | alpha.mxc          | 657                      | correct     | correct     | correct     |

| ave score | 1677/3000 = 55.9%  | loc. correct probability | 55.9% at 1  | 55.9% at 2  | 55.9% at    |

#### 4.3.3 Scenarios

Consensus Groups are formed with the primary intention of evaluating each other to determine which one will absorb the other. This can lead to several potential scenarios:

- Scenario 1: Consensus Group 1 possesses a higher score than Consensus Group 2. In this situation, Consensus Group 1, being superior, takes over Consensus Group 2, incorporating it into its structure.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/13.jpeg)

- Scenario 2: Both Consensus Groups have identical scores but a varying number of miners. Here, the group with fewer miners gains precedence and takes over the larger Consensus Group. This decision hinges on the principle of promoting efficiency and reducing unnecessary redundancy.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/14.jpeg)

- Scenario 3: Both Consensus Groups have equal scores and an equal number of miners. The resolution of this deadlock is achieved through a random selection of the group to take precedence and absorb the other.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/15.jpeg)

- Scenario 4: A Consensus Group faces challenges in validation due to certain miners. The problematic miners are disbanded from the group, and new, qualified miners replace them to restore functionality.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/16.jpeg)

- Scenario 5: A large Consensus Group is assessing another group, but some miners are unable to communicate with their counterparts due to the sheer scale of the group. In this case, a sub-Consensus Group forms, composed of miners that can engage with the target group. This sub-group then leads the evaluation process.
  ![](/img/LSC_img/17.jpeg)

These scenarios reflect the adaptability and robustness of the consensus decision-making process, allowing for flexibility in various circumstances while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the network.

### 4.4 Localization

Localization is a critical factor in our Consensus Group model, affecting the network's overall integrity and efficiency. Three important measures are employed to achieve this:

- Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA),
- Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

#### 4.4.1 TDoA

Time Difference of Arrival TDoA is a method for determining the position of a wireless device by measuring the time difference of signal arrival from the device to several receivers (miners in our case).
As the speed of the radio wave is known, these time differences can be translated into distances, thereby pinpointing the device's location. This method is particularly useful for verifying miner locations in the Consensus Group.

#### 4.4.2 RSSI

Received Signal Strength Indicator RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. This measure can provide an estimate of the distance between the miner and the LPWAN device, as signal strength generally diminishes with increased distance. RSSI plays a critical role in validating the locations of devices within the network, ensuring that the miner's reported location aligns with the expected signal strength.

#### 4.4.3 SNR

Signal-to-Noise Ratio SNR measures the ratio of the power of a signal (meaningful information) to the power of background noise (unwanted signal). Higher SNR values indicate cleaner, higher quality signals which are easier to distinguish from the noise. SNR can be used to estimate the quality of the signal received by miners, and therefore can indirectly infer their proximity to the LPWAN devices.

#### 4.4.4 Combining the methods:

Combining TDoA, RSSI, and SNR methods results in a more robust and reliable location estimation system. TDoA provides a primary location estimation, while RSSI and SNR offer supportive data to refine these estimations and validate them. This synergistic combination allows for more accurate determination of device locations, even in challenging network conditions.

The blend of these methods benefits the overall Consensus Group model by enhancing the certainty and accuracy of miner localizations. This, in turn, supports the key principles of the model, from the formation of Consensus Groups to the decision-making process and beyond. By ensuring correct device localizations, we reinforce the trustworthiness of the network, optimize network efficiency, and maintain the integrity of our LPWAN infrastructure.
